This is the official branch where I develop this coding extensively. If you need original work of coding aka. early development, you may refer to `MASTER` branch.

# Operational Performance Monitoring-Dashboard
This is a project that I develop in order to complete the requirement of my university on doing an internship at my host company.

Generally, the dashboard consists of key metrics that significane to review the performance of any services. In this case, it was used to monitor the performance of Calibration Services at my host company. It was deploy on a local server of my personal desktop, thus, any dummy data/passwords used throughout this development aint genuine and does not belong to any particular person/company.
