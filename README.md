# Operational Performance Monitoring-Dashboard
This is a project that I proposed and developed at my host company during my internship days.

Generally, the dashboard aims to consist various key metrics that significants to review the performance of any services which focuses on simplicity and quick information review. In this case, it was used to monitor the performance of Calibration Services at my host company. 

Most of the credentials used in the codes above were totally deployed on a local server in my own devices and none of the data shown is genuine. It was inteded to use as illustration proposes only.
